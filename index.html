        <p> I love baking because so fun. Whenever I hae spare moment I turn to baking. I love making cakes and cookies and even fancy desserts like meringes. My all time favorite dessert is a Tres Leches Cake but I yet have to make it myself. Even though I haven't been able to cook as often because I just started middle school I still try and find the time to do so. Just recently I made homemade chocolate chip cookies which are probably the best dessert I've made by myself before. It actually great that I love baking because I have a real sweet tooth and baking at home is way better for you than buying sweets. </p>
